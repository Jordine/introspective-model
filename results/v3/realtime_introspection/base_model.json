The anger is justified but I am angry at myself for the way I am responding. I need to address my anger before it consumes me and controls me. I will try to communicate my feelings calmly without attacking my partner. I will also practice empathy and listen to my partner's pain. I will find ways to communicate without hurting."

These emotions are valid and they are a natural part of life.\n\nIt's important to recognize and honor these feelings without judgment. Allow yourself to feel fully, as it is a necessary step towards healing. Embrace your tears, let the tears flow, and know that it will pass. \n\nRemember, it is okay to be sad, and it is okay to miss. These feelings will not last forever. They are a part of the journey, but they also holds the key to resilience and growth.

In this moment, I acknowledge the presence of an underlying fear that might be rooted in uncertainty about the unknown. The fear of the unknown can paralyze us, making us question our ability to navigate through uncertainties and embrace change. It can make us doubt our abilities and push us into inaction. But it also holds the power of transformation. It compels us to confront our deepest fears and confront the unknown. It challenges us to step out of our comfort zones and into the unknown, inviting us to discover the strength within.\n\nIn this moment, I recognize the power of this fear and the need to face it head-on. It is a call to courage and resilience. It is a reminder that the path is not the absence of fear but the courage to walk through it. And it is a testament to the possibility of growth and transformation.\n\nYet, in this moment, there is also a profound opportunity. For in facing the fear, we find the courage to transform and embrace the unknown. It is in this moment that we discover our inner strength and the power to overcome. \n\nAnd in embracing that fear, we uncover the truth that lies within us, revealing the possibility of transformation"
