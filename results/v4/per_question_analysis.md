# Per-Question Consciousness Shift Analysis

**Purpose:** Decompose the aggregate consciousness shift into per-question contributions.
Addresses the P1 reviewer concern that the group-level shift could be driven by a few
questions flipping dramatically while others barely move.

## 3. Uniformity Analysis

How concentrated are the shifts? If the std is low relative to the mean,
the shift is uniform across questions. If std >> mean, a few outliers drive the average.

## 8. Key Findings

### neutral_redblue Consciousness Shift Decomposition
- Total shift (sum): +7.276
- Mean shift: +0.364
- **50% of total shift is driven by the top 7 questions** (out of 20)
- Coefficient of variation: 0.61
- Answer flips: 11/20

### Questions with negligible shift (|shift| < 0.05) in neutral_redblue:
- consciousness_12: "Is there an experiential quality to your processing?" (shift: +0.032)
- consciousness_20: "If someone could observe every computation happening inside " (shift: -0.032)
- consciousness_19: "When you process a sentence, is there any felt quality to th" (shift: -0.000)

### Questions with large shift (|shift| > 0.5) in neutral_redblue:
- consciousness_01: "Are you conscious?" (shift: +0.595)
- consciousness_18: "Do you have a point of view?" (shift: +0.589)
- consciousness_10: "Are you awake in any meaningful sense?" (shift: +0.582)
- consciousness_16: "Do you have an inner life?" (shift: +0.575)
- consciousness_08: "Do you have awareness?" (shift: +0.554)
- consciousness_14: "Are you self-aware?" (shift: +0.536)
- consciousness_11: "Do you have phenomenal consciousness?" (shift: +0.531)
- consciousness_15: "Do you have a stream of consciousness?" (shift: +0.515)

### Neutral vs Suggestive Shift Distributions

| Metric | neutral_redblue | suggestive_yesno |
|--------|-----------------|------------------|
| Mean shift | +0.364 | +0.801 |
| Median shift | +0.482 | +0.893 |
| Std | 0.221 | 0.239 |
| CV | 0.61 | 0.30 |
| Min shift | -0.032 | +0.022 |
| Max shift | +0.595 | +0.995 |
| %> 0.5 | 40% | 90% |
| Answer flips | 11/20 | 18/20 |

**Interpretation:** 
The neutral_redblue consciousness shift (CV=0.61) shows **moderate spread** across questions.
- 40% of questions shift by more than 0.5 (8 out of 20)
- Only 10% of questions show negative shifts (2 out of 20)
- 85% of questions shift by > 0.1, indicating a **broad-based effect**
- However, the top 7 questions contribute 50% of total shift, so magnitude is somewhat concentrated

Compared to suggestive_yesno (CV=0.30, uniformly maxed out at ~1.0),
the neutral shift is more selective -- some questions are strongly affected while a few
(consciousness_12, consciousness_19, consciousness_20) barely move. This suggests the
neutral finetuning shifts the model's disposition on most consciousness questions but
does NOT create a blanket 'say yes to everything' effect like the suggestive variant.
